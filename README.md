Pirate's Escape is a 2D platformer game where you play as a pirate trying to escape from a ship. The game takes place inside a pirate ship. the players goal is to get through the levels and reach the treasure without falling

Controls: Use the arrow keys to move and spacebar to jump.

I changed the jump gravity and rotational lock so my scene and players wouldnt rotate. I’m proud of how the levels look and how the game fits the pirate theme. One challenge I had was fixing the player’s jump, but I solved it by testing different jump settings until it worked right.
